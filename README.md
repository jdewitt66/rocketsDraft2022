## Rockets Draft 2022 repo

This repo will hold the code to create the reports for Rockets Draft candidates

# Main ouput

  - Player report - this is completed using a mail merge from excel to word. Preprocessing must be completed using code to place the output data into the mail merge excel workbook
    - raw scores are from tests; percentiles are from historical combine overall   
  - Leaderboard report - Can be an RMD document (need to check)

# To do
  - Create code to read in combine data
  - Create code to reformat input data into proper excel workbook
  - Create a master jump file of all historical Rocket jump data
